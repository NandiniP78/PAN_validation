# PAN Number Validation Project
## Credits
This project idea was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1vlhH5LFY8&list=PLh8pnia8G97YXFz2fE_1v4bvnki7JKiEU&index=4).   
I have implemented the solution using SQL and Python as my own version of the project.

### Overview
This project validates Indian Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) using Python and SQL. PAN validation is critical for ensuring data accuracy and compliance in finance and taxation.
The goal is to check whether each PAN entry follows the official format and categorize them as Valid or Invalid.

### Tools Used
Python (pandas, regex, Jupyter Notebook)
SQL (validation queries)
CSV dataset

### Key Results
Built rules to validate PAN format:
10 characters long
First 5 alphabets, next 4 digits, last 1 alphabet
Classified records into Valid PAN and Invalid PAN
Automated validation logic in both Python and SQL
